                <p>Spring 2019 - As a team of four in this Interaction web Design course, we are presenting our final term
                    project named "The maid".
                    The maid is a interaction web base text explore game which the targeted audiences are both males and
                    females aged between 15 to 45, who are interesting with spend some time on text-image game. The main idea
                    of the website is to allow user to have immersion experience by interaction with the image.

                            <p>According to our research, we found out that the average number of best friends and good
                                friends of
                                every Canadian are getting lower throughout the years. Most people preferred to keep in
                                touch with
                                each other through social media apps without actually hanging out together. In fact, the
                                lack of
                                ‘face-to-face’ interaction will result in less close friends.

                            <p>We also found that since people start making friends on social media, the struggle of ﬁnding
                                a real
                                friend has become more obvious. People are struggling to be very real since they don’t
                                really know
                                each other very much or even never met before in real life. Thus, they will be a limit to
                                the number
                                of people which they can keep a quality friendship with, such as the type of friend they can
                                phone
                                for advice or help.
